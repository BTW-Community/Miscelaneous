# Jorge's Miscelaneous Addon for Better Than Wolves
Minecraft Better Than Wolves Addon

### Installation Requirements:

To install this mod you need Minecraft 1.5.2 and Better Than Wolves V4.A9 Pustules Lancing or newer installed correctly. Please check the instalation instructions for BTW before you install this addon.

### ------------ WARNING FOR ASTROLABE ADDON USERS ------------
If you do not use the Astrolabe addon you can skip this.

If you do use the Astrolabe addon on your game and you decide to install this addon alongside it, you must update Astrolabe to  version "4.1 Synergetic Relations" or newer. If you don't, you will have compatibility problems.

---

### ------------ IMPORTANT WARNING ------------
Make sure you make a backup of your saves and of your minecraft before you install this addon. The addon should not have any problems, but there may be bugs I have not come across yet, and they could make Minecraft crash, and on crashing you risk losing your inventory or corrupt your world. So MAKE A BACKUP!

---

### Installation:
Simply open your Minecraft.jar and drag all files from inside the JAR folder within the zip file inside it. Don't forget to delete the Meta-Inf folder, although if you already have the requirements installed and working you probably did this already.

Inside the config folder is the configuration file. If you wish to use it (not required) drag the config FILE ONLY (not the folder) into your base minecraft folder.
The file "JorgesMiscellaneousConfig.txt" defines the IDs for all the blocks and items on this addon. To fix ID conflict issues, just open the file and change the ID numbers. Be careful when doing this, as it may damage worlds already saved. Make sure you know what you are doing!

Ps. Just wanted to thanks FlowerChild again for this fantastic mod. Minecraft is not the same without it. Thank you.

-------------------------------------------------\
To uninstall: Simply copy your save to a pure BTW Minecraft instalation. All blocks and items in your inventory or placed in the world should just disappear.\

### Changelog:

###  - Version 1.0
First release.

Added the Arrow Marker blocks. They can be put on the ground over a solid block, and will point to the direction the player is facing. They can be rotated by right clicking with an empty hand. They are made of stone, so you need a pickaxe to break them.

To create an Arrow Marker, you need to follow this recipe:

_ D _
D _ D
S S S

Where:
 _ is an empty space.
 D is a dye item. You need three dyes of the same color. This addon is compatible with the Deco Addon, which means you can mix different same-colored dyes in one recipe. For example, you can use both white dye and bone meal together, you can use blue dye and lapis lazuli, but you cannot mix dyes of different colors.
